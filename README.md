The birthdays are automatically sorted to show the next upcoming birthday first, and the days until each birthday are calculated dynamically. The data persists in the browser's local storage, so the birthdays will remain even after closing the browser.

The interface is intuitive with a form at the top to add new birthdays and a list below showing all upcoming birthdays. Each birthday entry shows the person's name, their birthday date, days until their next birthday, and a delete button.
